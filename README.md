# Neural Network Challenge 2

HR Predicitons Assignment Challenge : 19 for AI/ML in Python bootcamp

This project uses a branched neural network to predict employee attrition and department fit.

## Steps:
- Loaded the dataset
- Selected 10 features for X
- One-hot encoded 'Attrition' and 'Department' for y
- Scaled X data
- Built a dual-output model with shared and branched layers
- Trained and evaluated the model

## Results:
- Attrition accuracy: ~81%
- Department accuracy: ~61%

## Notes:
Could improve by adding more features, tuning hyperparameters, and handling class imbalance more effectively.
